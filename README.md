# Pizza Sales-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard, created using SQL and Power BI tools, helps the pizza sales company understand their customers better. It assists the business in determining whether or not its clients are happy with its offerings. They learn about their areas for improvement through various ratings, and by recognizing these areas, they may enhance their services. Additionally, it indicates which days and months are the greatest and worst for sales, enabling the business to adjust its strategy.
The dashboard also evaluates which pizza sizes and categories are selling the best and worse, giving them information to improve their menu selections.
